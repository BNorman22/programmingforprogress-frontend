              <p><em>Does afterschool programs improve kids’ in-school performance?</em></p>
              <p>Hack Oregon explored this question with data partner <a class="link" href="https://oregonask.org/">OregonASK.</a> Nationally, about one in four families have children in afterschool programs — including before school, afterschool and summer activities. Nearly all parents — nine in ten <a class="link" href="http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/documents/AA3PM-2014/AA3PM_Key_Findings.pdf">surveyed</a> — are happy with these programs and believe they provide a range of skill development and enrichment activities that enhance their children’s social and emotional development, physical health, and academic achievement.<br>
              <em>Source: America After 3:00pm: Afterschool Programs in Demand (October 2014)</em><br>
              <a class="link" href="http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/documents/AA3PM-2014/AA3PM_National_Report.pdf">http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/documents/AA3PM-2014/AA3PM_National_Report.pdf</a></p>

              <p>In Oregon, a smaller share of children participate in afterschool programs — just 16%, up from 10% in 2004. Like parents nationally, nearly all (93%) Oregon parents are pleased with their children’s programs, citing benefits not just for their children but for their families and communities.</p>
              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>More than half (55%) of Oregon parents indicated that afterschool programming can excite kids about learning, and 59% indicated that the opportunity to gain workforce skills (e.g. teamwork, leadership, critical thinking, etc.) was an important benefit</li>
                
                <li>Nearly three-quarters (72%) felt that afterschool programming can reduce the likelihood of kids engaging in risky behaviors like crime or substance abuse</li>
                
                <li>Oregon parents also cited physical activity (93%), meals (78%), homework help (71%), and arts programs (68%) as important benefits of participation in afterschool programs.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Clearly, Oregon parents believe afterschool programming benefits their children. <a class="link" href="http://www.hfrp.org/out-of-school-time">But what does the evidence say?</a> Does programming help kids perform better in school? Are there additional outcomes we can measure?</p>

              <p>Several aspects of afterschool programming make these questions difficult to answer:</p>
              <p>
              <ol>
                <li>“Afterschool” includes a range of activities and programs — some are focused on care, others nutrition, and still others skills development. That’s why evaluations are typically case-study based, program specific, or relatively small-scale, making it difficult to determine whether “program participation” in general delivers benefits and for whom.</li>
                
                <li>Afterschool programs are typically grant-supported and are often either of relatively short duration, or are funded on a cyclical basis. This biases evaluation and data collection toward process studies and surveys — it’s hard to justify costly longitudinal studies more likely to reveal outcome and impact when programs are only funded for a few years at a time. </li>
                
                <li>Afterschool programs target low-income children or schools with large percentages of low-income children. Since low-income children typically do not perform as well as their higher income peers, it can be challenging to assess the effect of programming alone — authentic comparison groups are difficult to structure. </li>
              </ol>
              </p>
              <p>(<a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tu4v-b2tRxuokm2lD_emkDmzwVB-Tw8bHj93d81G8l0/edit#bookmark=id.40x97k3fd3zj"><em>Learn more about Afterschool Programming.</em></a>)</p>

              <p>But none of these challenges is insurmountable. And we have to start somewhere. So, with the help of <a class="link" href="https://oregonask.org/">OregonASK</a> and a team of dedicated volunteers, the Programming to Progress team sought to find whether programming helps Oregon kids do better in school.</p>

            </a>
            <div class="st-content">
              <p>We brought data on student achievement from the Oregon Department of Education together with afterschool survey data collected by OregonASK to examine this question.  Data collected by the Oregon Department of Education data is from the 2014-15 school year, while OregonASK’s data is from the 2013-2014 school year.</p>
          
              <ul>
                <li>Oregon Department of Education data comprises the results of students assessments in Math, English Language Arts, and Science during the 2014-15 school year. That year was a transition year for Oregon in its approach to students assessment.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Math and reading scores were derived from first use of the <a class="link" href="http://www.ode.state.or.us/search/page/?id=3298">Smarter Balanced</a> assessment.</li>
                    
                    <li>Science scores were derived from the <a class="link" href="http://www.ode.state.or.us/search/page/?id=1302">Oregon Assessment of Knowledge and Skills</a> (OAKS) assessment. </li>
                    
                    <li>The project used “met or exceeded benchmark” as its primary unit of performance analysis, rather than the numeric or percentage scores themselves. </li>
                  </ul>
                
                <li><a class="link" href="https://oregonask.org/">OregonASK</a> survey data was collected primarily via phone calls to programs together with site visits.OregonASK conducted their initial survey in 2011, and completed a comprehensive update in 2013-14. These surveys were the first, and remain the most extensive, effort to index afterschool programs in Oregon.</li>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Sites were asked about various aspects of their program including: structure, location, enrollment, capacity, timing, duration, meals, and sponsors/funding. Survey data was entered into a database, which remains the most comprehensive source of information about Oregon afterschool programs in the state. </li>
                    
                    <li>OregonASK’s database identifies approximately 800 afterschool programs across Oregon. Many of these programs have multiple sites within their community. </li>
                  </ul>
                
                <li>In certain instances, we employed data used our sister Hack Oregon projects <a class="link" href="http://4040100.hackoregon.org/">Education Pathways</a> (or <a class="link" href="http://4040100.hackoregon.org/">4040100</a>) and the Oregon Hunger Equation. (link when live).</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Our Approach</h3>
              <p>In order to isolate the effect of afterschool programming on student performance, we modeled the effect of poverty on performance first — because we know that <a class="link" href="http://marylandpublicschools.org/adequacystudy/docs/ConcentratedPovertyLitReviewFinalDraft-071015.pdf">poverty does impact student performance.</a></p>
              <p>We used free or reduced price lunch eligibility (FRLE) as an indicator of poverty and compared the percentage of students eligible in each of the schools in our data set (993) to the percentage of students in each school who met or exceeded math, reading, or science benchmarks on standardized tests.</p>
              <p>This resulted in a “best fit” line that shows the relationship between poverty and performance.</p>
              <p><img src="./img/about-page-best-fit.png" width="60%"></p>
              <p>We then computed the difference between the actual percentage of students meeting or exceeding benchmarks in each Oregon school to the expected percentage based on our model. We attributed the difference (residual performance) to programming.</p>
              <p>A full description of the methodology — including interim formulas and charts — is available <a href="https://github.com/hackoregon/education-data/tree/master/analysis">here</a>. </p>
